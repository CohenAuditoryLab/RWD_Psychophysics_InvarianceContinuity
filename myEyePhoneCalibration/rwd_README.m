%From old notes from 17-11-08 when did calibration with L and wrote Yale
%that it worked seems like you simply ran

StartCalibration_LSA('N')

%But check command history from this for more details

%Also may not be playing stimulus into this...therefore maybe can just do
%Amplitude increase on HRTF filtered data without harming calibration...

%Regardless, do a recalib just to stay up to date and then just run it on
%Sam.  As long as consistent with volume level put to should be fine.
